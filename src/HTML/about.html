               <h2 style="padding-left: 10px">What are AMPs?</h2>
               <p style="padding-left: 10px;padding-right: 10px;">
                 Antimicrobial peptides, or AMPs, are found in
                 virtually all forms of life, and form part of the important
                 components of the innate immune system of higher organisms. <br>
               </p>

		<p style="padding-left:10px;padding-right: 10px;">
		At the biochemical level, there appears to be huge similarities between the many AMPs. Most, if not all AMPs, are characterized by an overall positive charge with a large portion of hydrophobic residues. Yet, despite these apparent biochemical similarities, there is a huge diversity in their amino acid sequences. Consequently, AMPs have evolved 2 distinct mechanisms by which they are able to assert their effects. One class of AMPs -the direct acting antimicrobial host-defense peptides - act directly on the foreign pathogen, and has a broad spectrum of activity. These includes anti-bacterial, anti-fungi and anti-viral activities, with some being known to act on HIV and cancer cells. The other class of AMPs act by modulating the host immune system. The former class, with its rapid mechanism of action and broad activity has been studied as potential novel antibiotics.

		 <p style="padding-left: 10px;padding-right: 10px;">
		   However, despite great promises, clinical trials
		   have brought about modest results. Most peptides
		   have demonstrated relatively low efficacy, and much
		   remains to be known about the molecular mechanism
		   by which AMPs exert their potent activity. Due to
		   a lack of awareness in the mechanism, concerns over
		   the toxicity of AMPs have prompted most AMP-based
		   medications to be topical-application-based, hence
		   severely limiting the broader appplication of these
		   drugs.

		 <h2 style="padding-left: 10px">Just another AMP database</h2>

		 <p style="padding-left: 10px;padding-right: 10px;">
		 Over the past few years, there have been numerous attempts made by other labs to attempt construct their own database of AMPs. However, many of these databases are relatively niche, with very specific appliations. Inevitably, there will be repeated records of some AMPs, where they are assigned different database identifiers by the respective database creators. However, we recognize that a non-redundant database will be beneficial to researchers as this will significantly reduce confusion in communications. Strikingly, there has not been any serious attempts made to create such a non-redundant database, despite that there are now more than 10 different AMP databases. We hope that this database will represent a step in the right direction towards a non-redundant AMP database. It is hoped that by providing a comprehensive database of AMPs, researchers might be able to identify potential AMP-like peptides based on their similarity to already known AMPs. This can be done using the BLAST-interface, which allows researchers to BLAST a sequence of interest against our AMP database.Moreover, we hope that this integrated database pulling AMPs from a wide range of AMP databases, some of limited but specialized scope, will enable researchers to explore the evolutionary history of these intriguing molecules,  as well as to study the cognate genes and their regulatory mechanisms.

		 <h2 style="padding-left: 10px">Statistics</h2>
		 <p style="padding-left: 10px;padding-right: 10px;">
		 To date, this database contains over 8246 records extracted
		 from existing databases and integrated into a unified 
		 interface. Of these,    are unique sequences. 
		 Additional annotation of AMP functions from source records
		 and their bibliographic reference have been carrried out to
		 resolve any ambiguities of the sequences and their 
		 accompanying annotations. Across all AMP database, there
		 are numerous redundant sequences, which we have identified
		 and created a non-redundant set of sequences which are 
		 also BLAST searchable and downloadable.
